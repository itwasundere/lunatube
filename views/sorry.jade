div We're over capacity. http://i.imgur.com/eiVnq.png I'm sorry, but I simply do not have enough money right now to afford a better amazon server. We encourge you to try again in few minutes and come back next week. Lunatube.tv was a beta test, and I never antcipated so many users. I am humbled by your visit. There is a max of 150 users in this room right now. That said, scability is a main priority and we will be ready to handle up to a thousand users during our next beta party.
